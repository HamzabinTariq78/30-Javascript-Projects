# Color Generator

This simple web application allows users to generate random colors with a click of a button. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Click the "Generate" button to generate a random color.
3. The background color of the page, along with the displayed color code, will be updated to the newly generated color.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `style.css`: The CSS file defining the styling of the web page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for generating and displaying random colors.

## CSS Styles

- The page is styled to be visually appealing.
- The color generator is contained within a box with a white background and a subtle shadow.
- The button and color code text are styled for better visibility.

## JavaScript Logic

- The `ColorGenerator` function is responsible for generating a random hexadecimal color code and updating the styles of the HTML elements accordingly.
- The initial color is set when the page loads.

Feel free to customize and enhance the application as needed. Enjoy exploring a world of random colors!
